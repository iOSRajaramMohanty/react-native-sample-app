# react-native-sample-app

I used the following packages:
1. Redux for managing the app’s state
2. React-Redux, will be used to connect our app’s components to the redux store.
3. Redux Thunk is a middleware for Redux that allows us to write action creators that return a function instead of an action.
4. React Native Router Flux for our apps navigation,
5. React Native Elements as our UI Toolkit,
6. React Native Size Matters for scaling the size your apps UI across different sized devices,
7. Axios, a promised-based HTTP client for making calls to our API
8. Moment.js
